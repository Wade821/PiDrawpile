# PiDrawpile

Project moved to https://github.com/Bluestrings-Drawpile/PiDrawpile

This contains scripts for setting up the Drawpile Server on Raspbian 4.9 (or higher) for the Raspberry Pi 3, 
though I'm sure it could be used in other setups. 

I'm currently working on a major update that will provide smarter scripting to check installed packages to 
make sure things will work as expected, and warn when certain things are not the correct version. As of
right now, there is a known issue getting it to compile with Drawpile 2.1.8. A fix is in the works, but
being that I cannot do the coding to make it work, this is dependent on Calle Laakkonen himself to make
the appropriate patch so I can make the script work. 

When setting up the server for the first time, make the file 'drawpile-installer-official-build-from-sources'
executable as a script using chmod or right click it to change its properties accordingly. Videos will be
released once the major script update is done to simplify and show how the process works.
